## Background

As a male born in China in 90s, watching Japanese adult video is very normal. Even though there are many ridiculous mistakes in those movies, we have learned a lot from those things. I appreciate for this. However, apart from some very famous actresses, such as Maria Ozawa, who else do we know? When a beautiful actress shown in the movie, can we find out who she is? As Japanese adult video industry produces tens of thousands of movies every year with plenty of new actresses, it is harder for us to remember all of them.

At the same time, using deep learning method face recognition has achieved the same performance as human being. It has been used to solve many real-world problems. So why can’t we use it to do something funny and helpful?

This is the reason why I try to write such a project.

## Pipeline

To start from scratch, we need to collect enough actress images, clean the images, and choose a perfect model to train. 

-	collect data: As the copyright of most images are held by related companies, so I can’t share them with you. But there is a scrapper script listed in this project. You can use it to download images from JAV database[]. Similarly, you can write your own script to collect images from other websites.

-	clean data: Except some rotogravure images, the actress images we collected is dirty, and have much noise. To some grand face datasets, noise is not important. As we have a pretty small dataset, we should clean is before usage. Another import thing in this part is face alignment. It will help us to achieve a better result.

-	train CNN model: After all those things above done, we can choose a CNN model to train. I can’t figure out what structure a perfect model would have. But I know you should choose your model structure according to the size of face recognition dataset. With a big dataset, you can choose a big and complicated structure; with a small dataset, you shall choose a small structure to avoid over fitting. Before training, you should also have to choose a loss function. Here, I will use center loss, as it’s simple but good.

-	predict: With the CNN model and all the features of actresses, you can predict who the actress is. Hereby, I use KNN to do face recognition. There are some other machine learning methods. You can try if you like.

## Problems

Though the pipeline seems simple, there would be many problems. And it is hard to achieve an excellent accuracy as the problems are difficult to be solved. 

In the first step, the website of JAV database is forbidden in China. So either you use a foreign server to download the images, or you use network agent. 

In the second step, there are many dirty images in the dataset. In some images, there are more than one actress; in other images, the actor in the picture is male. And when you try to align the face, some rotated faces are difficult to detect.

In the third step, you should do many experiments to choose the model and loss function. As deep learning look like a black box sometimes, you might spend quite a lot time on it. 

## dependence

To use this script, you have to install many packages. They are listed below.
